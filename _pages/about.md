I am an Assistant Professor at Toulouse School of Economics.   
I did my postdoc at Harvard University under the supervision of Prof. Rajarshi Mukherjee and Prof. Subhabrata Sen. During my PhD I was advised by Prof. Alexandre Tsybakov (CREST/ENSAE). 
I am interested in various topics such as minimax testing, local differential privacy, robust statistics, benign overfitting, nonparametric regression or low-rank tensor estimation.

Before that I got an engineering degree from Ecole polytechnique and graduated both from ENSAE and from the master MVA (Machine Learning and Computer Vision) 
from ENS Paris-Saclay.
